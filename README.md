This is our team project for CS2103T; it is based on the AddressBook-Level3 (AB3) project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

In addition to the functionalities provided in AB3, we introduce features that can help NUS students better manage their contacts' information.
## Project Details
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

## Selected features
* Integration with [NUSMods](https://nusmods.com): this allows users to seamlessly add a contact's timetable to their info.
* Improved Search: we allow users to find coursemates for any of their courses making it easier to find teammates in advance.

For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[NUSMates Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.
