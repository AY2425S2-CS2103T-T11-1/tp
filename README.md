**NUSMates allows NUS undergraduate students to record the contact details of their fellow NUS undergraduate students.** With NUSMates, you can record NUS-specific contact information such as [year](#year), [major](#major), housing, and [modules](#module).
NUSMates also makes it seamless to record [module](#module) information using an [NUSMods link](#nusmods-link), helping you easily find friends who are taking the same [modules](#module) - so you can form project groups, share notes, or know who to reach out to for help.

This is our team project for CS2103T; it is based on the AddressBook-Level3 (AB3) project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org). In addition to the functionalities provided in AB3, we introduce features that can help NUS students better manage their contacts' information.

## Project Details
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

## Selected features
* **NUS-Specific Information:** users can add NUS-specific contact information such as year, major, housing, and modules
* **Integration with [NUSMods](https://nusmods.com):** this allows users to seamlessly add a contact's timetable to their info using a NUSMods link.
* **Module Search:** we allow users to find coursemates for any of their courses making it easier to find teammates in advance.
