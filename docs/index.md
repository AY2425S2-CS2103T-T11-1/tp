**NUSMates allows NUS undergraduate students to record the contact details of their fellow NUS undergraduate students.** With NUSMates, you can record NUS-specific contact information such as year, major, housing, and modules.
NUSMates also makes it seamless to record module information using an NUSMods link, helping you easily find friends who are taking the same modules - so you can form project groups, share notes, or know who to reach out to for help.

* If you are interested in using NUSMates, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing NUSMates, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
