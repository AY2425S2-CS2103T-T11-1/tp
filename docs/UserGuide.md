# NUSMates User Guide

NUSMates allows NUS undergraduate students to record the contact details of their fellow NUS undergraduate students. With NUSMates, you can record NUS-specific contact information such as [year](#year), [major](#major), [housing](#housing), and [modules](#module).
NUSMates also makes it seamless to record [module](#module) information using an [NUSMods link](#nusmods-link), helping you easily find friends who are taking the same [modules](#module) - so you can form project groups, share notes, or know who to reach out to for help.

#### You will love NUSMates if you are:
* An NUS undergraduate student who frequently uses NUSMods
* Socially active in NUS with a need to manage the contacts of your fellow NUS undergraduate students
* Frequently use NUSMods to plan, record, and share your course schedules
* Tech-savvy and familiar with installing jar files
* Can type fast and prefer using CLI apps over mouse interactions

> üí° You can quickly look up all commands in the [Command Summary](#command-summary), and check the [Glossary](#glossary) if you‚Äôre unsure about any technical terms used.

## Features

#### Notes about the command format:
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the [parameters](#parameter) you must supply when entering commands such as `add` or `edit`.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a [parameter](#parameter) which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/tag]...` can be used as `t/NUS Amplified`, `t/NUS Amplified t/NUS Computing Club` etc.
* [Parameters](#parameter) can be in any order.<br>
    e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* ‚ö†Ô∏è If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Adding a person: `add`

### Saving and editing the data [file](#json-file)

NUSMates data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

NUSMates data is saved automatically as a [JSON file](#json-file) `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data [file](#json-file).

>‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:** <br>
> If your changes to the data [file](#json-file) makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data [file](#json-file) at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the [file](#json-file) before editing it.<br>
> Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data [file](#json-file) only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to get the NUSMods Link

>üí° What is NUSMods? <br>NUSMods is a website used by NUS students to view and plan their module timetables. A typical NUSMods timetable might look something like this:
![nusmods_sample.png](images/nusmods_sample.png)
>You can share your NUSMods timetable with others using an NUSMods link. NUSMates uses this NUSMods link to record the module information of a contact.

To obtain the NUSMods link:

### Step 1: Share/Sync
Click on the `Share/Sync` button on the top right.
![nusmods_step1.png](images/nusmods_step1.png)
### Step 2: Show original link
Click on the `Show original link` button to convert the shortened NUSMods link to the original one.
![nusmods_step2.png](images/nusmods_step2.png)
### Step 3. Copy
Copy the link, and you're done!
![nusmods_step3.png](images/nusmods_step3.png)

You can now use this link as the `l/NUSMODS_LINK` parameter in the [add](#adding-a-person-add) or [edit](#editing-a-person--edit) commands.

## Detailed Installation Guide

This section helps you install and run NUSMates, even if you have never used a [terminal](#terminal) or heard of [Java](#java) before. Just follow the steps one by one!


### Step 1: Check if you already have Java

NUSMates runs using [Java](#java), which is a common tool installed on many computers.

#### To check:
1. Open your [terminal](#terminal):
   - On **Windows**: Press the `Windows` key, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
   - On **macOS**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `Terminal`, and hit Enter.

2. Type this into the terminal and press Enter:
   ```
   java -version
   ```

3. If you see a version number that starts with `17` or higher, you‚Äôre good to go. Move to [Step 2](#step-2-download-the-nusmates-jar-file).

4. If you see an error, or a number less than 17, you‚Äôll need to install Java. Follow the guide for your operating system below:

   - [Java Installation Guide (Windows & macOS)](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallation.html)


### Step 2: Download the NUSMates `.jar` file

1. Go to the latest release of NUSMates by [downloading the `.jar` file](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T11-1/tp/releases)

2. Click on the most recent version, and download the file that ends with `.jar`. (e.g. `nusmates.jar`)


### Step 3: Choose a [home folder](#home-folder)

1. Create a new folder anywhere you like, e.g., on your `Desktop` or in `Documents`.
2. Give it a name like `NUSMates`.
3. Move the downloaded `.jar` file into this folder.


### Step 4: Open the [terminal](#terminal) in that folder

You‚Äôll now ‚Äúgo into‚Äù the folder using the terminal.

#### On Windows:
1. Open **File Explorer** and navigate to your NUSMates folder.
2. In the address bar at the top, type `cmd` and press Enter.
3. A [terminal](#terminal) window will appear, already inside the folder.

#### On macOS:
1. Open the **Terminal** app.
2. Type `cd ` (with a space), then drag and drop your NUSMates folder into the terminal.
3. Press Enter.

> üí° If you're curious, `cd` means ‚Äú[change directory](#cd-command)‚Äù ‚Äî it tells your terminal to go into a folder.


### Step 5: Run NUSMates

Now that you‚Äôre in the correct folder, run this command:

```
java -jar nusmates.jar
```

If everything works, a window will pop up showing NUSMates with some sample contacts.

‚ùå If you see an error:
  - Double-check that you're in the correct folder and that the file name is exactly `nusmates.jar`.
  - Make sure [Java](#java) was installed properly.
  - Visit the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for more help.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data [file](#json-file) it creates with the [file](#json-file) that contains the data of your previous AddressBook [home folder](#home-folder).

**Q**:  Can I use NUSMates on my mobile device?<br>
**A**: NUSMates is a command-line application that may not be optimized for mobile devices. 
It‚Äôs best used on desktop environments where a terminal or command prompt is available.

**Q**: How do I get the NUSMods link?<br>
**A**: You may refer to the detailed step-by-step guide [here](#how-to-get-the-nusmods-link).

**Q**: Can I add two contacts with the same name?<br>
**A**: No, AddressBook3 (AB3) does not allow duplicate names when adding contacts. 
Each contact must have a unique name in the system.
To add multiple people with the same name, distinguish them in some way such as adding a descriptor (e.g., John Doe (Work)) or a number (Amy1, Amy2).

**Q**: Can I edit a contact's module information manually?<br>
**A**: No, a contact's module information is automatically retrieved from the NUSMods link they provided.
If their schedule changes, simply ask them to send you the updated link, and you can update their module information using the [edit](#editing-a-person--edit) command.

## Troubleshooting

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the [GUI](#gui) will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` [file](#json-file) created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
