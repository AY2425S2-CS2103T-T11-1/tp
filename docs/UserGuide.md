# NUSMates

NUSMates allows NUS undergraduate students to record the contact details of their fellow NUS undergraduate students. With NUSMates, you can record NUS-specific contact information such as year, major, housing, and modules. 
NUSMates also makes it seamless to record module information using NUSMods links, helping you easily find friends who are taking the same modules - so you can form project groups, share notes, or know who to reach out to for help.

## Features

> üí° Notes about the command format:
> 
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters you must supply when entering the command.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
>
> * Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
> 
> * Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
> 
> * ‚ö†Ô∏è If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Adding a person: `add`

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL y/YEAR m/MAJOR h/HOUSING l/NUSMODS_LINK t/TAG‚Ä¶‚Äã`

e.g. You can add a contact with only name, year, and major using `add n/John Doe y/2 m/Computer Science`<br>
* A person can have any number of **tags**, including none.<br>
* `LINK` refers to the student's NUSMODS course schedule original link.

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com y/2 m/Computer Science  h/UTown Residence l/https://nusmods.com/timetable/sem-2/share?CS2103T=LEC:G12`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com y/1 m/Electrical Engineering h/PGPR p/1234567 l/https://nusmods.com/timetable/sem-2/share?CS2040=TUT:12,LAB:06,LEC:1`

###
### Editing a person : `edit`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Troubleshooting

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
