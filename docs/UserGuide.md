# NUSMates User Guide

NUSMates allows NUS undergraduate students to record the contact details of their fellow NUS undergraduate students. With NUSMates, you can record NUS-specific contact information such as [year](#year), [major](#major), housing, and [modules](#module). 
NUSMates also makes it seamless to record [module](#module) information using [NUSMods link](#nusmods), helping you easily find friends who are taking the same [modules](#module) - so you can form project groups, share notes, or know who to reach out to for help.

### Saving and editing the data [file](#json-file)

NUSMates data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

NUSMates data is saved automatically as a [JSON file](#json-file) `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data [file](#json-file).

>‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:** <br>
> If your changes to the data [file](#json-file) makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data [file](#json-file) at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the [file](#json-file) before editing it.<br>
> Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data [file](#json-file) only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## Troubleshooting

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the [GUI](#gui) will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` [file](#json-file) created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
3. **To transfer your data to another computer,** install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data [file](#json-file) it creates with the [file](#json-file) that contains the data of your previous AddressBook [home folder](#home-folder).
